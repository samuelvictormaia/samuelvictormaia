## 🌱 About Me

My journey with technology began when I was 12, configuring and customizing Lineage II servers in the old L2JBrasil community.  
Even without a computer at home, I handled full server setups: installing MySQL, configuring databases, migrating DBs with Navicat, editing XML files, customizing websites, and connecting everything to dedicated hosts.  

Those early experiences gave me a solid understanding of how systems work — from database to front-end.  
I learned to deal with real-world problems, integrations, and deployments, realizing that code could bring ideas to life for hundreds of people online.  

Now at 26, I keep that same mindset: **I learn fast, think practically, and never stop trying.**  
Coming from a humble background taught me persistence and focus, and in Front-End development I found the perfect balance between **design, logic, and visual impact**.  
My goal is to build interfaces that make people’s lives easier and prove that dedication and curiosity are the true engines of growth.
